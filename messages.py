Welcome to TeleWhisperEVO! 🤖 🚀
    
(EVO stands for EVOlution, as this is a complete rewrite of the original bot @TeleWhisperBot)

It works with groups now!

It now works with a new, faster and more accurate transcription service! 🎉

Start by clicking -> /intro to get used to the bot.

This bot is an omni-tool for Telegram, capable of:
    - Transcribing voice messages (With files up to 2GB 🤯 - tested up to 100MB ~ 2H audio file)
    - More coming soon! (type /coming_soon to see what's coming)

The bot is still in development, so some features may not work as intended. 🛠️
Inconveniences? Ideas? @Telewhispersupport. 🐞

If you want to support the development of the bot, you can donate to the developer with /tip. 🙏

-------------------------
Type /help for more info about the commands 📚
-------------------------

Please enjoy the bot and report any bugs to @Telewhispersupport. Thank you! 🙏
